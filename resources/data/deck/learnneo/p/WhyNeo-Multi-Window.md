Neo.mjs applications can also launch as <i>shared web workers</i>, which allows you to have a single 
application run in multiple browser windows; those windows can be moved to multiple monitors.

For example, you can have a data analysis application with a control panel on one monitor, 
tabular data in another, and charts on another &mdash; all sharing the same data, handling events
across windows, running seamlessly as a single application.
